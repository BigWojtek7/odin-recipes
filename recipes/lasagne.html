    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups plain tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups vegetable broth, or more as needed</li>
      <li>½ cup dry red wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil</li>
      <li>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce.</li>
      <li>Start preparing pasta after sauce has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese on top has browned, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
